ðŸ‘­ðŸ‘¬ This project is all about a queue simulator designed for a customer service setup with human servers and self-checkout counters. It meticulously tracks customer arrivals, service, waiting times in queue, and also accounts for server breaks, particularly for human servers. By using Java's random number generation, the simulator offers a clear picture of real-world queuing dynamics, enabling precise analysis of system performance.

Concepts used:
- Java OOP
- Design Principles: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritence and Polymorphism
